# Cryptocurrencies

## **Overview**
In this project, we were asked to create a report that uses unsupervised machine learning to group cryptocurrencies to create a classification system in order to review the investment portfolio.

## **Results**
We used the unsupervised machine learning clustering algorithm.  We went through the following steps:

1. Preprocessed the cryptocurrency data for PCA.
2. Reduced the data dimensions using PCA.
3. Used K-means for clustering cryptocurrencies.
4. Visualized the results with 3D-scatter graph and hvplot scatter graph.
